[2020-03-19] Problems need to fix:

1. For all tb_xxxxxx series functions, there is no operation to free the memory generated by malloc inside these functions because it always turned out a software break point error(BKPT) while freeing.

2. For "74XX164" functions, it has 50 present chance to go wrong.

3. After showing the result of manual test report, it always failed to return the user manual but there is no hardware fault. It is just an error of display.

4. If system received an invalid string word from keyboard, there is no operation to inform user that format is not supported.
